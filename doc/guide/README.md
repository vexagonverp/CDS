## Development Setup

### Back-end

1. You need a PostGreSQL server running. Install and run PostGreSQL according to your OS with username=postgres, password=Abcd1234, database=postgres
   
   - Install and start postgres server on windows:
     - Download postgres binary from https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries and extract it
       
       ```bash
         cd pgsql\bin
       ```
     - initialize database with password Abcd1234
       
       ```bash
         initdb -D ..\pgdata -U postgres -W -E UTF8 -A scram-sha-256
       ```
     - start database:  
       
       ```bash
         pg_ctl -D ..\pgdata -l logfile start
       ```
   - Install and start postgres  for other operating system:
     - https://www.postgresql.org/download/

2. You also need Consul up and running (in development mode). 
   
   - Install and start postgres server on windows:
     - Download postgres binary from https://www.consul.io/downloads and extract it
     - Start consul
       
       ```bash
         consul agent -node=cdo-consul -dev -client 0.0.0.0
       ```

3. Start the Gateway service (spring boot project)
   
   - Download source: http://tfs.logigear.com/MWD/_git/CDO
     
     ```bash
       cd gateway
     ```
   - Run project either SpringToolSuite4 or command as following
     
     ```bash
       ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```

4. Start the crm-certification-service service (spring boot project)
   
   - Download source: http://tfs.logigear.com/MWD/_git/CDO
     
     ```bash
       cd crm-certification-service
     ```
   - Run project either SpringToolSuite4 or command as following
     
     ```bash
       ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```

5. Start the crm-employees-service service (spring boot project)
   
   - Download source: http://tfs.logigear.com/MWD/_git/CDO
     
     ```bash
       cd crm-employees-service
     ```
   - Run project either SpringToolSuite4 or command as following
     
     ```bash
       ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```
     
     **Notes**
     
     If ./mvnw spring-boot:run could not run, please install mvn wrapper:
     
     ```bash
     cdo-aas$ mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
     ```

### Front-end

Front-end is a webserver run at port 4200

1. The Angular application can be started with npm. First, you need to download the dependencies with:
   
   ```bash
    crm-app-client$ npm install
   ```
2. Then, you start the server with:
   
   ```bash
    crm-app-client$ npm start
   ```

## Manual Deployment

### Back-end

1. You need a PostGreSQL server running. Install and run PostGreSQL according to your OS with username=postgres, password=Abcd1234, database=postgres
    Note: If you want to access PostGreSQL from outsite loclahost, edit pg_hba.conf in the installed folder and edit following line:
   
   ```
    # IPv4 local connections:
    host    all             all             all
   ```
   
    Install postgres server on windows:
   
        - Download postgres binary from https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries and extract it
        - cd pgsql\bin
        - initialize database: initdb -D ..\pgdata -U postgres -W -E UTF8 -A scram-sha-256 then enter password Abcd1234 (username is postgres)
        - start database:  pg_ctl -D ..\pgdata -l logfile start

2. You also need Consul up and running (in development mode). Follow the instructions for your OS, for example:
   
   ```bash
    $ consul agent -node=cdo-consul -dev -client 0.0.0.0
   ```
   
    Then edit the rabbitMQ address in global_config.json and import global configuration setting as following:
   
   ```bash
    $ consul kv import @global_config.json
   ```
   
    Go to Consul web management at  http://localhost:8500 and edit rabbitMQ and PostGreSQL address then save it

3. You need a RabbitMQ server running. Run the server according to the instructions for your OS, for example:
   
   ```bash
    $ rabbitmq-server
   ```
   
    Open to rabbitMQ web manager at http://localhost:15672/, login with default user 'gues't (password: 'guest'). Create user 'hung' with password 'hung' as following:
    
    ![alt text](./images/rabbitMQCreateUser.png)
    
    If you want to access your rabbitMQ server outside localhost, double click on created user and add permission for this user:
    
    ![alt text](./images/rabbitMQAddRemotePermission.png)

4. To start the Authentication&Authorization microservice, you must edit Consul configuration in application.yml 
    
    ![alt text](./images/consulConfiguration.png)
   
   Then  use the command line with the included Maven wrapper:
   
   ```bash
    cdo-aas$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

5. To start the Employee microservice, you must edit Consul configuration in application.yml as in step 4 and run the command line with the included Maven wrapper:
   
   ```bash
    cdo-employee$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

6. To start the Gateway microservice, you must edit Consul configuration in application.yml as in step 4 and run the command line with the included Maven wrapper:
   
   ```bash
    gateway ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   *Notes*
   If ./mvnw spring-boot:run could not run, please install mvn wrapper:
   
   ```bash
    cdo-aas$ mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
   ```

   ```

## Deployment with Docker

1. Install Docker Desktop
	+ Windows: [Install Docker Desktop ](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
	+ macOS:  [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

2. Change directory from root project  to docker folder:
   
   ```bash
   cd docker
   ```
3. Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service
   
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Run importDB.bat to create database
